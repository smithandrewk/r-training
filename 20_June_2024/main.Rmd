# Intro to Bioinformatics Day 2

-   4 "base pairs" ATCG

-   A - T

-   C - G

-   T - A

-   G - C

-   Human DNA Sequence is approximately 4.8 billion base pairs

-   ATGCTATCTATCTATCTATCTACGGCGATCGATGGTA could be a gene

-   Humans have \~40,000

-   We work with infectious disease. Diseases (bacterial, viral) commonly have "genomes" or DNA sequences

-   Strep, COVID, salmonella

-   COVID has variants.

-   COVID genome is about 29000 base pairs
